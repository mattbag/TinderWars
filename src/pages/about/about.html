  <p>After a few hours of tinkering (and after a solid week of work) I couldn't come up with a better and funnier idea, especially
    because the api seems pretty limited to me. So I decided to cross merge 2 api to gather the images and took this as a
    learning experience. I also ditched the code prettiness to take some hours off. But it was a great idea and let's do it again!</p>

  <p>To speed up the process I used some great components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/yannbf/ionic3-components" target="_blank">Tinder UI</a>
    </li>
     <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/yannbf/ionic3-components" target="_blank">App theme switched</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
